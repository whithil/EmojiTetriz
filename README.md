## About Our Default Custom Minoes

Meet our default custom minoes, Jorge and Luka!

*   **Luka** (🔴): He's small and just wants to play! His simple 3-node matrix makes him easy and pleasant to place.
*   **Jorge** (🈂️): He WILL MAKE YOU PAY! Jorge is a complex piece made out of the Japanese tax emoji – handle with care!

(You can find them in Settings > Fun Box > Manage Custom Minoes if you enable the "Enable Custom Minoes" feature and your custom mino list is empty.)
